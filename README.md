### App Idea

I want to build an app that helps undocumented or low-income immigrant families find free or low-cost healthcare and immigration legal aid. The app would include:
- A location-based service directory
- A document checklist for healthcare or DACA
- Event reminders and appointment scheduling tools  
The idea comes from my work with Las Voces Latinas and my personal connection to the immigrant community.


## Notes

I accidentally had triggered a segue from the button to another screen. After reviewing the storyboard connections, I removed the unintended segue.
I also had a issues with copying my repository and had to resart my project and follow the steps very closely
